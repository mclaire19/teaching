Storage for some original curriculum materials created for PPOL561: Accelerated Statistics II. Each directory includes R Markdown files for `xaringan` presentations, data used in presentation, and files created from knitting the presentation. There is currently a presentation for Data Wrangling using the `tidyverse` packages and Data Visualization using `ggplot2`.
